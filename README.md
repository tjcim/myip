# MyIP

This is a simple package that retrieves the external public IP. It uses a third-party API to retrieve the response using the `requests` library.

This project was built along with the post: [https://www.tjc.im/python/packaging/](https://www.tjc.im/python/packaging/) to teach how to package python projects.
